Password Generator Assignemnt.

For this assigment we've been tasked with creating a random password generator.

I have a good grasp of Javascript fundamentals and think this project has come along quite well. The final version is yet to be completed but another few days and I should have it figured.

Most of the project i haven't found ridiculously difficult and has been a fun challenge, however I'm currently still fguring out how to write what is in the console to the document itself.

Also my generator perhaps isn't quite as random as it should be currently. I haven't quite got the hang of selecting the number of characters the user desires. I've got this figured out for uppercase character but not quite there with the rest of the characters / symbols.
